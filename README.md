# CRISPRtarget
**CRISPRtarget** is custom Perl and Shell scripts for base substitution and indel frequencies calculation.

# Features

Calaulate base substitution and indel frequencies of target gene for CRISPR genome editing.

# BAM format file

SAM file was originally mapped form BWA-MEM.

# Prerequisites

**Software / Package**

* [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) v5.26.2
* [BioPerl](https://bioperl.org/) v1.7.2
* [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) Version: 0.7.17
* [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) Version: 1.9
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [GNU coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)

# Usage: 

-----------------------------------
To calculate base substitution and indel frequencies, BAM format file was generated firstly.

All Perl and Shell scripts were marked ***'bold italic'***.
* 1. Please export the CRISPRtarget directory and BioPerl to your **$PATH**.
```bash or zsh
export PATH="~/CRISPRtarget-master:$PATH";
export PATH="~/Bio:$PATH";

```

* 2. BWA index target sequences. 
***'01_bwa_mem_index.sh'***.
```bash
sh 01_bwa_mem_index.sh target.fa
```

* 3. BWA-MEM mapping with DNA-seq reads (FASTQ). For paired-end sequencing, only R1 reads were used.
***'02_bwa_mem_mapping.sh'***.
```bash
sh 02_bwa_mem_mapping.sh target.fa sample_R1.fq sample_R1
```

* 4. Calculate base substitution with mapped reads (BAM).
***'03_base_substitution.sh'***.
```bash
sh 03_base_substitution.sh sample_R1.bam target.fa sample_R1
```
*Output file **sample_R1.xls** is an example result of base substitution.

* 5. Calculate indel frequencies with target gene InDel location.
***'04_indel_frequencies.sh'***.
```bash
sh 04_indel_frequencies.sh sample_R1.bam EXM1 250 300 ascii.txt
```
*Output file **EMX1_indel_frequencies.txt** is an example for the number of indel frequencies of target EMX1.

-----------------------------------

## Input files
1. Target sequences. [target.fa]
2. DNA-seq R1 reads, FASTQ file. [sample_R1.fq]
3. Name of BAM file. [sample_R1, sample_R1.bam and sample_R1.bam.bai will be generated]
4. Target gene symbol. [EMX1]
5. Start location for indel frequencies calculation of target gene. [250, cutting site -25 bp for EMX1]
5. End location for indel frequencies calculation of target gene. [300, cutting site +25 bp for EMX1]
6. The sequence quality of reads by ASCII code. [ascii.txt]
